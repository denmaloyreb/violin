            <p>There are several courses in Violin that differ in duration, program, and cost. However, regardless of the course, it is much more profitable at the price to engage with school teachers, rather than with Tutors. While studying in the Studio,
                students get the opportunity to additionally rehearse outside of school hours, make recordings in the Studio, perform at apartment parties and concerts, select a convenient schedule of classes and get a certificate at the end of training.</p>
